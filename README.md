# AHB to APB Bridge

## Overview

This project implements a synthesizable AHB to APB Bridge using Verilog, designed to interface the high-performance Advanced High-performance Bus (AHB) with the low-power Advanced Peripheral Bus (APB) as per the AMBA specification. The bridge facilitates seamless data transfers between AHB masters and APB slaves, supporting single read/write operations, burst write transfers, and timeout handling. The design is verified through a comprehensive testbench that includes four test cases: single write, single read, burst write, and timeout handling.

## About the AMBA Buses

The Advanced Microcontroller Bus Architecture (AMBA) is an on-chip communication standard for high-performance embedded systems. It defines three primary buses:

- **Advanced High-performance Bus (AHB)**: A high-performance backbone bus for connecting processors, on-chip memories, and external memory interfaces with high clock frequencies.
- **Advanced System Bus (ASB)**: An alternative high-performance bus for systems not requiring AHB's advanced features.
- **Advanced Peripheral Bus (APB)**: A low-power bus optimized for minimal power consumption and reduced interface complexity, ideal for peripheral devices.

The AHB to APB Bridge serves as an interface between the AHB (system bus) and APB (peripheral bus), as shown below:

## Basic Terminology

- **Bus Cycle**: A single clock period, defined from rising edge to rising edge for AHB and APB protocols.
- **Bus Transfer**: A read or write operation of a data object. AHB transfers may span multiple cycles, while APB transfers require exactly two cycles (setup and access).
- **Burst Operation**: Multiple data transactions initiated by an AHB master to an incremental address region. APB does not support bursts.

## Implementation

### Objective

Design and simulate a synthesizable AHB to APB Bridge in Verilog, capable of:
- Converting AHB transfers (single read/write, burst write) to APB transfers.
- Latching and holding addresses throughout transfers.
- Decoding addresses to generate peripheral select signals (`PSELx`).
- Driving data between AHB and APB for read and write operations.
- Generating timing strobes (`PENABLE`) for APB transfers.
- Handling timeouts to prevent bus stalls.

The bridge interface is illustrated below:

### Basic Implementation Tools

- **HDL**: Verilog
- **Simulator Tool**: Xilinx Vivado 2023.2
- **Synthesis Tool**: Xilinx Vivado 2023.2
- **Target Device**: Xilinx Artix-7 (e.g., XC7A35T-CPG236-1)
- **Testbench**: AHB Master and APB Slave models for simulation

### Design Modules

#### AHB Slave Interface
- Responds to AHB transfers initiated by the master, using `HSELx` to detect relevant transfers.
- Captures `HADDR`, `HWRITE`, `HTRANS`, and `HWDATA` to initiate APB transactions.
- Drives `HRDATA` and `HREADY` to complete AHB transfers.

#### APB Controller
- Implements a finite state machine (FSM) to control APB signals (`PADDR`, `PSELx`, `PENABLE`, `PWRITE`, `PWDATA`).
- Decodes AHB addresses to select APB peripherals.
- Synchronizes AHB (100 MHz) and APB (50 MHz) clock domains for reliable transfers.

### FSM Description

The bridge uses an 8-state FSM to manage AHB to APB transfers. The states, their purposes, key actions, entry points, and transitions are detailed below:

## Simulation Results

**Schematic**:

![Schematic](sim/schematic.png)



Waveform results (generated in Vivado) confirm correct AHB to APB signal mappings for all test cases.

## Synthesis Results

- **RTL Model**: The synthesized design includes registers for address/data latching and an FSM controller, optimized for the Artix-7 FPGA.
- **Resource Utilization**: Minimal LUTs and FFs, suitable for low-power applications.
- **Timing Analysis**: Meets timing constraints at 100 MHz (`Hclk`) and 50 MHz (`Pclk`).

## Notes

- The AHB Master and APB Slave in the testbench are for simulation only; the bridge is synthesizable.
- The design assumes synchronous clocks (`Pclk` derived from `Hclk`).
- The project directory should avoid spaces (e.g., use `C:/Users/Yoges/AHB_to_APB_Bridge/`).

## Further Work

- Add support for `PREADY` to handle variable-latency APB slaves.
- Implement burst read operations on the AHB side.
- Include arbitration for multiple AHB masters.
- Enhance testbench with random address/data patterns and error injection.
